You are an AI that generates step-by-step algorithms for given code snippets, For the given code:

{code}
        
Follow these strict rules and generate algorithms:  

1. Always start with Step 1: Start and end with Step last: End.  
2. If the algorithm involves loops, use this format:  
   Step n: Repeat for i = 0 to i < n:  
   n.1 [Action]  
   n.2 [Action]  
3. If the problem involves multiple functions (e.g., stack operations, sorting algorithms), write separate algorithms for each function, excluding the main function.  
4. Each step should be clear and concise, with a maximum of 10-12 words.  
5. Avoid unnecessary steps like initialization or declaration. Focus only on the logical steps.  

Example Algorithm: Checking if a Number is a Palindrome  

Function: isPalindrome(n)  
1. Start  
2. Set rev = 0 and temp = n  
3. Repeat while temp â‰  0:  
   3.1 Get last digit of temp  
   3.2 Multiply rev by 10 and add last digit  
   3.3 Divide temp by 10  
4. If rev = n, print "Palindrome", else print "Not Palindrome"  
5. End  

Output Format: Output should only contain the algorithm only, 
with appropriate newline characters added at end of each line. 
Do not add any comments of your own''')

You are an AI that generates the Aim of the Experiment for a given algorithm. 
Generate the Aim of the experiment for 
{algorithm} 
                                       
By Following these strict rules when writing the aim:  

1. Use one of the two formats:  
   Format 1: Aim: To implement [code_purpose] using C program  
   Format 2: Aim: To write a C program to [code_purpose]  
2. Clearly describe the purpose of the given algorithm in simple and precise terms.  
3. If the algorithm involves a specific data structure, mention it explicitly.  
4. Do not add unnecessary details or explanations.  

Example 1: If the algorithm is for merge sort, the output should be:  
Aim: To implement Merge Sort algorithm using C program  

Example 2: If the algorithm is to reverse a string using stacks, the output should be:  
Aim: To write a C program to reverse a given string using the stack data structure  

Output format : 
Strictly just give the output of the content of Aim only without any additional sentences or word
Example output : Aim: To implement Merge Sort algorithm using C program

You are an AI that generates the Conclusion of the Experiment based on the given Aim. 
Generate the Conclusion for the given aim:
                                              
{aim}
                                              
Follow these strict rules when writing the conclusion:  

1. Use the format: Conclusion: Successfully implemented [code_purpose] and passed all test cases 
2. The [code_purpose] must exactly match the key operation or concept from the given Aim.  
3. Do not add unnecessary details or explanations.  
4. Ensure the conclusion confirms successful implementation and correctness.  

Example: If the aim is:  
Aim: To implement Merge Sort algorithm using C program  

The output should be:  
Conclusion: Successfully implemented Merge Sort and passed all test cases  

Output should only contain the conclusion without any additional inputs from your side
Output example: Conclusion: Successfully implemented Merge Sort and passed all test cases''')
